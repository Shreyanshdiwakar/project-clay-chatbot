# Deploying to Vercel

This guide will help you deploy your Next.js application to Vercel, which is often the easiest option for Next.js apps.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Your Next.js project (projectclay-chatbot)
3. A Vercel account (you can sign up for free with your GitHub account)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

First, create a new repository on GitHub named `projectclay-chatbot`.

Then, push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/projectclay-chatbot.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up or log in with your GitHub account
2. Click on "Add New..." and select "Project"
3. Import your `projectclay-chatbot` repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js app
5. Keep the default settings and click "Deploy"

That's it! Vercel will build and deploy your application. When the deployment is complete, you'll receive a URL where your application is live (typically something like `projectclay-chatbot.vercel.app`).

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default Vercel subdomain:

1. Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to configure DNS settings

## Automatic Deployments

One of the benefits of Vercel is that it automatically deploys your application whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository. Simply make your changes and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update application"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application.

## Environment Variables (If Needed)

If your application uses environment variables:

1. Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
3. Add your environment variables
4. Save and redeploy your application

## Benefits of Vercel

- Zero configuration needed for Next.js apps
